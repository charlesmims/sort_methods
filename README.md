I was recently challenged to come up with a method for sorting a list.  My naive_sort method here is what I came up with.  It's nothing fancy, but surprisingly it runs faster than some more sophisticated algorithms I tried.


```
naive sort averaged 3.23326947689 seconds
high_low sort averaged 3.54343266487 seconds
selection sort averaged 9.48918526173 seconds
```
